# Apprentice Service Technical and Security Principles
This site documents the technical standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [ESFA Apprenticeships Service](https://www.gov.uk/topic/further-education-skills/apprenticeships)
to follow when building digital services.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual),
which covers service design more broadly.

It is inspired by the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance)

The initial draft was lifted from the [Department for Education Technical Guidance](https://dfe-digital.github.io/technology-guidance/#dfe-digital-technical-guidance)

## Principles

{% assign principle_groups = site.pages
  | where: "principle", true %}

{% for principle in principle_groups %}
- [{{ principle.title }}]({{ principle.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}

## Standards

{% assign standards = site.pages
  | where: "standard", true
  | group_by: "category" %}

{% for standard_group in standards %}
{% if standard_group.name != "" %}
### {{ standard_group.name }}
{% else %}
### General standards
{% endif %}

{% for standard in standard_group.items %}
- [{{ standard.title }}]({{ standard.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

## Guides

{% assign guides = site.pages
  | where: "guide", true
  | group_by: "category" %}

{% for guide_group in guides %}
{% if guide_group.name != "" %}
### {{ guide_group.name }}
{% else %}
### General guides
{% endif %}

{% for guide in guide_group.items %}
- [{{ guide.title }}]({{ guide.url | relative_url }})
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

# Thing you're writing about

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing about is important. The [title should probably be a verb, not a
noun][good-services-are-verbs] (e.g. “Storing source code”, not “Code
repositories”).

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

The service manual has some useful information on
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).
